I am a postgraduate student from School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Bihan Wen](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/bihan.wen/) and working closely with [Yufei Wang](https://wyf0912.github.io/). I am also a Research Intern at [StepFun](https://www.stepfun.com/chats/new). Before that, I was a remote Research Assistant of the AI Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Wang Hao](https://wanghao.tech/). I received my B.Eng. at School of Instrument Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm). During the final semester of my undergraduate studies, I worked as a remote Research Assistant at the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), supervised by [Prof. Yilang Shen](https://shenyl-sysu.github.io/about/).

My primary research interests lie in generative AI and vision-language understanding, as well as their development and applications in various downstream tasks.
